# MCUsernameChecker
A very simple tool, to check if a minecraft username is already a premium user or not.
Every message is written in german, because some of my friends wanted to use them for themselves.

The usage is similarly simple:

1. You type in a username with following allowed characters: 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9' and '_'
2. You press the button to check. It's pretty simple, isn't it? ^^
